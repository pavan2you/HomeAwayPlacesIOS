# HomeAwayPlacesIOS
A Generated code base using jVanila, j2OjbC and HomewayPlaces Android.

HomeAwayPlaces Android project followed the clean technology agnostic way of developement approach. As a result of which, 
majority of the code committed as part of initial commit is code converted by using jVanila-iOS-Conversion Script, which is a wrapper around the Google's j2ObjC tool.

Please refer the conversion code log homeawayplaces_ios_conversion_log.txt for details.

The advantage of technology agnostic approach, the development teams can share the majority of the solution or product's business logic.
The project source structure can be broadly classified into 3 sections.

CodeConversion
  - By using jVanila-iOS-Conversion script.
  
CodeGeneration
  - The remaining code DTOs / DAOs / Gateways can be generated by tool or can manually written like a template filling.
  
Presentation Logic
  - This is where the real implementation of View Contracts goes in and the developers would be spending majoirty of their time here. Because the other layers are either code generated or code converted.
